Analysing e-commerce sales of summer clothes from Wish.com

This data is taken from a Kaggle Dataset here (https://www.kaggle.com/jmmvutu/summer-products-and-sales-in-ecommerce-wish#). I will be creating a project plan to tackle this analysis in the most efficient way.

The aim is to analyse the products that come up on Wish when you search "summer" which was crawled in August 2020. The products on Wish have a lot of data that can be anaysed such as units sold, pricing, average rating, number of reviews, whether it has an urgency banner, merchant rating, etc. This makes it a really interesting dataset to investigate how and to what extent can ratings of products and merchants affect the purchase for example. 

Personally, I know that if I see a rating below 4/5 of a product in any online store I would question it. The fact that this is Wish data makes this analysis even more interesting considering how Wish is notorious for misreprenting products. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, and I want to find out!
